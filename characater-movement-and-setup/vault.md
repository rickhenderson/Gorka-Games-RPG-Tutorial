# Vaulting

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVhH2qi2B5Q Gorka Games RPG tutorial Episode 3.

If you have trouble getting your vault working, here is the first step that can be tested to see if your vault is correct so far.

Check list:
* Did you turn on the Motion Warping plugin?
* Did you restart the editor?

In this next image, you can see 2 sphere traces coming from the player. Trace 0 misses the red barrier block. Trace 1 hits the block, and so far our blueprint is set to stop after we get a hit.
