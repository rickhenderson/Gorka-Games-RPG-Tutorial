# RPG Tutorial by Gorka Games

I started learning Unreal Engine 5 in late 2022 just after I spent 2 months diving deep into Blender. I am amazed at the speed of Unreal Engine 5!

I found [Gorka Games](https://www.youtube.com/@GorkaGames) and he has amazing videos, and has released a game on Steam.

This is a repo of my work from following his action [RPG tutorial series](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiSlOaRBfgkcPAhYpGps16PT_9f28amXi) started in February 2023.

## Timeline

* March 5, 2023: Uploaded my work so far, which is up to [episode 2](https://youtu.be/WcDj4uZygyE) in the tutorial. Completed walk, run, crouch, and lean movements for the basic Quinn character in UE5.1.1.
